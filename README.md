My playground

Its not supposed to be anything in particular yet. My plan is to use a variety of tools that I come in contact everyday while coding, as well as experimenting with tools I have yet to master, these include: Angular, Firebase, React, Rails, Grunt, Sass, Backbone, jQuery, Underscore, Jasmine, PHP, etc.
